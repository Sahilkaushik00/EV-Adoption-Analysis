# EV-Adoption-Analysis


Project Description:
The "Electric Vehicle Adoption Analysis" project focuses on exploring and understanding the electric vehicle (EV) landscape in the United States by analyzing a comprehensive dataset obtained from data.gov. This dataset encompasses valuable information about the number and technical details of electric vehicles currently in operation across the nation.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains multiple columns, including:

County
City
State
Model Year
Make
Model
Electric Vehicle Type
Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility
Electric Range
Vehicle Location
Electric Utility
Project Objectives:

Data Exploration: The project will begin by conducting a thorough exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, quality, and potential insights it may offer.

Geographic Analysis: Geographic patterns of electric vehicle adoption will be analyzed to identify regions with higher EV adoption rates, factors contributing to this trend, and opportunities for further growth.

Temporal Trends: The project will investigate how electric vehicle adoption has evolved over time, considering the model year of vehicles and changes in government incentives and policies.

Electric Vehicle Types: The analysis will categorize electric vehicles based on their types, such as battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), to discern the popularity of each type and their presence in various regions.

Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Eligibility: The project will explore the implications of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle eligibility on EV adoption and the role of government incentives.

Electric Range: Understanding the distribution of electric ranges among electric vehicles, as well as the influence of range on adoption rates.

Vehicle Location: Investigating the distribution of electric vehicles across different locations, such as urban, suburban, and rural areas, to identify any spatial trends.

Electric Utility Partnerships: Analyzing the involvement of electric utilities in promoting EV adoption and the impact of such partnerships.

Expected Outcomes:
The project aims to provide valuable insights into the current state of electric vehicle adoption in the United States, identify factors influencing adoption rates, and offer recommendations for policymakers and industry stakeholders. The analysis may reveal opportunities for increasing the adoption of electric vehicles, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting sustainable transportation solutions.
